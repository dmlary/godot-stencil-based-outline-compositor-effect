## Godot Stencil-based Outline CompositorEffect

This is a CompositorEffect for Godot 4.5 that uses the stencil buffer to create on-screen outlines.
It uses the jump-flood algorithm described by @bgolus in his well-written article about [making very wide outlines](https://bgolus.medium.com/the-quest-for-very-wide-outlines-ba82ed442cd9).
I did not implement any of the anti-aliasing described in the article, but would happily merge anyone adding them.

### !!! Important Note !!!
When running this CompositorEffect in an embedded game panel (floating or docked), if you resize the window, the CompositorEffect may hit some asserts because the Editor is freeing the texture buffers while the CompositorEffect is running.  This **does not** happen in a non-embedded instance of the game, so I'm not going to write a pile of code to work around it.

### Details/Setup
For any mesh you want to be outlined, you need its material to write a value to the stencil buffer:

You need to add the CompositorEffect to the Camera3D, and configure it.  Note: depending on the material used to write to the stencil buffer, you may need to change the `Effect Callback Time`:
